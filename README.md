# Weather App
Responsive weather app with current weather and 4 day weather
forecast for any city.

Used Openweather API for weather details.

To use the App, you need to generate an API key from openweather and insert it in apikey in script.js
Then it will function properly as it can be seen at https://weatherquery.free.nf

Please note: Minimum and maximum temperatures are the minimum temperature and the maximum temperature recorded in the city at a given time(not the daily minimum and maximum). They have same value except for the cities with multiple weather stations.
